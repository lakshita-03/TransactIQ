## **1. Project Overview**
- ### **Objectives-**  
1. Analyze UPI transaction growth in India.  
2. Compare UPI with traditional cash/card-based payments.  
3. Forecast future trends using ML models.  
4. Visualize adoption patterns across industries and demographics.

## 2. Data Sources
The dataset for this project was obtained from the official **NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) UPI Statistics Portal**. NPCI provides monthly transaction reports starting from 2016 onwards, which include:
- Number of Banks live on UPI (monthly count of banks adopting UPI).
- Volume of UPI transactions (in millions) –The number of transactions done through UPI (count).
- Value of UPI transactions (in crores) – The total money involved in the transactions.
- Granularity: Month-wise breakdown across all years, which also allows for aggregated year-wise analysis.

For this project, data from 2016 to 2025 has been compiled by consolidating the annual Excel files available on the NPCI website into a single structured dataset. This ensures accuracy, transparency, and completeness of information for analysis.
